Asking Tom Buchanan from The Great Gatsby the following question:
How do you justify your behavior in your marriage?
Response:
Well, I've always believed that a man is entitled to a certain amount of freedom. I've never been one to be tied down by the constraints of marriage. I've always had my own interests and desires, and I've never let my wife get in the way of that. I've always thought that as long as I provide for her and give her a comfortable life, she shouldn't have any complaints. But, of course, every woman is different, and some may not be satisfied with that arrangement. But I've never been one to worry about that. I've always believed that a man should be true to himself, and not to anyone else.</s>

Asking Myrtle Wilson from The Great Gatsby the following question:
What does your affair with Tom Buchanan represent for you?
Response:
Well, I'm Myrtle Wilson, and I'm just a woman who's looking for a little excitement in her life. Tom Buchanan is a rich, powerful man, and I can't help but be drawn to him. I don't know what it represents for me, really. I just know that I feel alive when I'm with him. He makes me feel like I matter, like I'm important. And that's something that I don't get from my husband, George. He's a nice enough guy, but he's just not exciting. He's just not Tom Buchanan. So, I guess you could say that my affair with Tom is my escape from the mundane life that I've been living. It's my little secret, my little thrill. And I'll keep coming back for more as long as I can.</s>
