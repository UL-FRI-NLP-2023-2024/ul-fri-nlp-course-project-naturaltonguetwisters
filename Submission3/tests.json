    "answer": "Michael is a comforting presence, but sometimes I feel like he's just a placeholder in my life. Our relationship lacks the depth and connection I once had with Kai.

    "answer": "The gypsy caterpillars represent the inevitable invasions and disruptions in life. Just as they destroy the new leaves on my trees, my past and unresolved emotions gnaw at my peace. The caterpillars are a reminder that some threats can't be easily eliminated, and they force me to confront the deeper issues I have been avoiding."
